    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital signatures are used in every-day life to determine the authenticity of any number of messages of any type, from websites and APIs to E-mail and other messages. Whenever someone connects to a website with HTTPS, digital signatures are involved in the authentication of that website and the public key infrastructure (PKI) used to establish trust with the server. These digital signatures are based on a set of algorithms collectively called \"digital signature algorithms\" that include RSA, DSA, and ECDSA as well as some of the newer quantum-resistant algorithms such as \"Dilithium\" and \"Sphincs+\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange algorithms enable two parties communicating over an insecure channel to establish a mutual secret without it being transmitted over that channel. These algorithms allow the two parties to agree on a shared symmetric secret key over the insecure channel. That shared symmetric secret key can then be used for any purpose, including authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) using algorithms such as AES-GCM, or authentication using symmetric keys employing hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffie-Hellman-type algorithms are arguably the most valuable assymetric algorithms known to man: they are typically used for generating shared secret keys, but they *could* be used for signatures as well. In this paper, I will argue for this assertion by presenting a protocol for signing and verifying using a Diffie-Hellman-type construct in conjunction with quantum-safe symmetric cryptography. Grover's algorithm notwithstanding, symmetric cryptography *is safe* as soon as one doubles the key sizes vs. before quantum computers were a thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue for post-quantum cryptography is that with the advent of ever-larger quantum computers, we are likely to reach a point where an implement of Shor's algorithm capable of breaking current cryptography becomes viable. Shor's algorithm is the algorithm that breaks all \"classic\" asymmetric cryptography used today, including digital signature algorithms like RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA; diffie-hellman key exchanges like Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH), and Key Encapsulation Mechanisms like RSA. Once a quantum computer large enough to implement Shor's algorithm with sufficient capacity to break a 2048-bit RSA key is viable, which will likely happen within the next two decades, we will have to rely on post-quantum cryptography to replace the classic algorithms we use today.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently no standard post-quantum algorithms to replace the standard asymmetric cryptography algorithms we use in every-day life. NIST, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology, is managing an open process to find and standardize such algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Until recently, one of the most promising post-quantum asymmetric cryptography algorithms was an algorithm from the family of DH algorithms, and DSA and KEM algorithms seemed less promising both in their efficiency and their security. That was until July 2022, when an [attack](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1026) on Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) was found that can be performed on a classical computer and thoroughly breaks the security of SIDH. There is still hope, however, with lattice-based algorithms, and with algorithms based in learning-with-errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four algorithms that made it to round four of [NIST's search for post-quantum cryptography](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography) include [three DSAype algorithms and one KEM-type algorithm](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/selected-algorithms-2022). None of the are DH-type algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am obviously not presenting a post-quantum Diffie-Hellman-type algorithm: I'm not that good at math! I also don't know how much more difficult it would be to come up with a DH-type algorithm than it is to come up with a DSA-type or KEM-type algorithm, but I understand that all of these algorithms are based on the difficulty of reversing certain operations. RSA and DH are based on the difficulty of finding the prime factors of a large integer (which Shor makes relatively easy); ECC is based on the difficulty of dividing one point on an elliptic curve by another to find a very large integer (the one originally used for the multiplication); lattice-based algorithms are based on the difficulty of finding a point on a multi-dimensional lattice defined by a set of vectors that are almost aligned with each other (which is much easier when those vectors are almost perpendicular to each other); etc. These are called \"trapdoor functions\" and are what allow asymmetric cryptography to exist. What's needed is a trapdoor function that is difficult for both classical and quantum computers, and allows a DH-like protocol where a local private key and a remote public key can be used to generate a shared secret, without having to communicate anything other than the public key. Both KEM and DSA can be built out of that, the former of which I've already show, and the latter of which I will show in this paper."

The function to generate a keypair generates two keys, which we will call $sk$ for the private key and $pk$ for the public key $$\\langle sk, pk\\rangle = G$$ The signing function $S$ is defined as $$sig = S~sk~m$$ where $sig$ is the signature and $m$ is the message. The verification function $V$ is defined as $$r = V~pk~m~sig$$ where $r$ is a boolean result.\n",

    "If Alice wants to send a message $m_{a\\rightarrow b}$ with Bob, she can use a DSA to sign that message, and anyone with her public key $pk_a$ can verify that signature. A DSA can be used to sign any message, including a public key or a certificate containing one."

    "The protocol is entirely built on a combination of asymmetric and symmetric cryptography, where the only asymmetric cryptography used is a Diffie-Hellman-type algorithm. In the proof of concept an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman is used, but any Diffie-Hellman-type algorithm that implements the two functions $G$ and $X$ described above can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles of operation\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol is based on the idea of using public data to deterministically generate the second key pair used in the DH key exchange $s = X~sk_a~pk_b = X~sk_b~pk_a$. That public data is derived from the message being signed itself, using secure hash algorithms, and then used to generate a symmetric key which, in turn, is used to sign the message using an HMAC algorithm. The idea here is that, in a scenario where Alice signs a message for Bob to verify, both Alice and Bob can generate the second key pair, but only Alice knows the private key of the first key pair. The security of the scheme is based on the difficulty of finding a private key for a given public key, and the security of the hashing algorithms used.\n",

    "* a function $P$ that will transform a single large integer into a private key suitable for use with the function $X$.\n",
    "* a function $U$ that computes a public key from a given private key.\n",
    "* a secure hash function $H$.\n",
    "* a secure HMAC function $M$.\n",
    "* an HKDF function using the underlying HMAC $M$, $K_M$\n",

    "## Signing\n",

    "1. Given a message from Alice to Bob $m_{a\\rightarrow b}$.\n",
    "2. Given Alice's keypair $sk_a, pk_a = G$.\n",

    "9. Compute $m' = M~s~m_{a\\rightarrow b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value $m'$ is the signature for the message $m_{a\\rightarrow b}$. It is calculated using a keyed HMAC. This HMAC uses a key that is derived using an HKDF that uses a value derived from the message as its salt, and a value derived from the DH-type exchange function as its IKM. The public key used in that exchange is derived from a private key which, itself, is derived from the message as well. This means that to produce this signature, the only value that is employed that is not known to Bob is Alice's private key. Alice can therefore send $\\langle m_{a\\rightarrow b},m'\\rangle$ to Bob and does not need to provide any additional data beyond her public key."

We should note, though that this multiplication of a secret integer value with the generator point of the curve gives us a point on the curve, not a large integer value. To obtain a large integer value, we \"compress\" the point we obtained by taking only the X coordinate of the value, and the final bit of the Y coordinate.
